## Adding a Background Video

To add a racecar video to the home screen:

1. **Download a video** - Get a live action F1/racecar video from one of these sources:
   - **Pexels** (free): https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/f1/ or https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/race%20car/
   - **Pixabay** (free): https://pixabay.com/videos/search/formula%201/ or https://pixabay.com/videos/search/racing/
   - **Coverr** (free): https://coverr.co/s/race%20car
   - **Videvo** (free): https://www.videvo.net/

2. **Rename the video** to `racecar.mp4`

3. **Place it in this folder** (`assets/racecar.mp4`)

4. **Restart the Streamlit app** to see the video on the home screen

## Video Recommendations

For best results:
- Use MP4 format (most compatible)
- Keep file size under 50MB for faster loading
- Use horizontal/landscape orientation
- Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or lower
- Video will auto-play on loop with audio muted

## Note

Video files are excluded from git (via .gitignore) to keep the repository size manageable.
